  <h5>My experience</h5>
  <img class="aligned" src="lights.jpg" width=400px>

  <p>The aurora borealis was visible for a few hours last Friday night across New England, causing<br>
    people to go outside and see the beautiful pink sky for themselves. Those who stayed up late<br>
    even saw green hues close to midnight. I personally had no idea it was happening, so when I<br>
    went out in my driveway I found out only when was confronted by the illuminated sky.
  </p>

  <p>While the event was visible with the naked eye as a clearly abnormal pink glow in the night sky,<br>
    iPhone’s “Night Mode” setting automatically adjusts photos taken in low lighting to be brighter,<br>
    leading to intense and stunning captures of the event.
  </p>

  <h5>Why Did It Happen? This Is The Science.</h5>

  
    <p>
      When intense eruptions of radiation from the sun’s surface known as solar flares occur, the<br>
      continuous flow of protons and electrons from the sun’s atmosphere known as solar wind is<br>
      <img class="aligned" src="solarwind.png" width=400px>
      intensified by the energy produced. Solar winds are always deflected to the North and South<br>
      poles by Earth’s magnetic field (produced by the movement of molten iron in its outer core),<br>
      causing the Northern Lights when these particles collide with gasses in Earth’s upper<br>
      atmosphere creating flashes of light. 
    </p>
    
    
 

    
    <p>
      However, these flashes become more abundant and intense when the additional energy from<br>
      solar flares reach Earth. In the weeks leading up to the event, several X-Class solar flares<br>
      occurred, with the most intense happening on October 3rd.
    </p>
   
  

  <p>
    This intense energy strongly enhanced the Northern Lights, causing them to be visible from<br>
    many places they are usually unviewable from. This is how the event was able to illuminate the<br>
    dark night sky of New England on October 11th.

                    <p>I can relate to that since I didn't figure out either until after. In my opinion it's cooler when you don't really have an explanation.</p>

                    I found this very interesting and I think a table 
                    would work well to show what different auroras look 
                    like and why they occur (such as the different colors and what they mean). </p>

                    <p>This is a very interesting idea, I didn't even think about why the color was so different from the green and blue Aurora up North.

                    I really liked how you used CSS and you had me 
                    hooked the whole time, but is their any links or 
                    things you used to learn this information so I can 
                    research it further?

                  <p>I believe the overall content of the page is spectacular as it provides
                     a detailed explanation into the aurora as well as showing diagrams of how it
                      happens. However, I have a few criticisms with the actual code part.
                       For example, you should make the pictures on the side clickable so that
                        a user can more easily see them. You should also probably add a link to
                         your Email when clicking on your name.</p>
