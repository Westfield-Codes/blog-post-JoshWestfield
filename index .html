  <h5>My Experience</h5>
 <a href="lights.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligned" src="lights.jpg" width=400px></a>

  <p>The aurora borealis was visible for a few hours last Friday night across New England, causing
    people to go outside and see the beautiful pink sky for themselves. Those who stayed up late
    even saw green hues close to midnight. I personally had no idea it was happening, so when I
    went out in my driveway I found out only when was confronted by the illuminated sky.
  </p>

  <p>While the event was visible with the naked eye as a clearly abnormal pink glow in the night sky,
    iPhone‚Äôs ‚ÄúNight Mode‚Äù setting automatically adjusts photos taken in low lighting to be brighter,
    leading to intense and stunning captures of the event.
  </p>

  <h5>Why Did It Happen? This Is The Process.</h5>

  
    <p>
      <strong>Increased sun activity causes auroras to be more intense and frequent.<br></strong>
      <em>The diagram on the right illustrates the following process.</em>
    </p>


      <a href="solarwind.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligned" src="solarwind.png" width=400px></a>
      

      <ol>
        <li>Radiation erupts from the sun's surface. This is called a <strong>solar flare</strong>.</li>
        <li>Solar wind, which is the continuous flow of protons and electrons from the sun's atmosphere,
        carries this energy to earth.</li>
        <li>Solar wind is always deflected to the North and South
          poles by Earth‚Äôs magnetic field which is produced by the movement of molten iron in its outer core.</li>
          <li>The deflected solar wind particles collide with gasses in Earth's upper atmosphere creating flashes of light. This produces the Aurora Borealis.</li>
          <a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronomy/northern-lights/what-are-northern-lights.asp"<li><em>source</em></li></a>
      </ol>
    </p>
    
    
 

    
    <p>
      However, these flashes become more abundant and intense when the additional energy from
      solar flares reach Earth. In the weeks leading up to the event, several X-Class solar flares
      occurred, with the most intense happening on October 3rd.
    </p>
   
  

  <p>
    This intense energy strongly enhanced the Northern Lights, causing them to be visible from
    many places they are usually unviewable from. This is how the event was able to illuminate the
    dark night sky of New England on October 11th.

                    <p>I can relate to that since I didn't figure out either until after. In my opinion it's cooler when you don't really have an explanation.</p>

                    I found this very interesting and I think a table 
                    would work well to show what different auroras look 
                    like and why they occur (such as the different colors and what they mean). </p>

                    <p>This is an interesting thought. I looked into <a href="https://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/polar/EPO/auroral_poster/aurora_all.pdf" 
                      target="blank_">this document</a> (page 3) and found that the color depends on several factors such as which gas(ses) collide with solar wind
                       as well as the intensity of the collisions.

                    I really liked how you used CSS and you had me 
                    hooked the whole time, but is their any links or 
                    things you used to learn this information so I can 
                    research it further?

                    <p>Nasa has published a much more detailed document on Auroras
                       <a href="https://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/polar/EPO/auroral_poster/aurora_all.pdf" 
                       target="blank_">here</a>. If you want to see a more entertaining source, 
                       the NOAA basically has a weather forecast but for auroras

                  <p>I believe the overall content of the page is spectacular as it provides
                     a detailed explanation into the aurora as well as showing diagrams of how it
                      happens. However, I have a few criticisms with the actual code part.
                       For example, you should make the pictures on the side clickable so that
                        a user can more easily see them. You should also probably add a link to
                         your Email when clicking on your name.</p>

                      Spectacular post! I'd capitalize "My Experience". You're missing an external link 
                      and a table or list; also there are stray &lt;br&gt; tags in your paragraphs. And there 
                      is not link back to the Blogroll page. Fix those! Your post design asks a question about 
                      Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) re contrast: background vs text color. 
                      Check out https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5 and add your colors 
                      (background #F3839F and text #212529) and your rating is "good" (three stars). 
                     You are more of a five-star guy ... so I would change the background of the content 
                     area to #F3C9D4 and get four stars.

                      <p>Thanks for the feedback. I played around with the text/background contrast for a while and settled on a color I believe works well with the text but still looks consistent with the images and theme. I deleted the extra &lt;br&gt; tags and implemented a maximum width for the paragraphs in the CSS. I rephrased the scientific overview as a list, since the old paragraph was too long and wordy which could have turned away readers. I also implemented a back button in the top left, added a link to my source for the scientific process, and fixed the grammar error you mentioned.</p>
